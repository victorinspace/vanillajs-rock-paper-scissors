## Summary
Using my previous experience building a To-Do app, I have taken all that I have learned to make a classic game in the most succinct way that I can. This took a  week to build out, about 15 hours total. Much of my focus was in using as little scripting as possible while making as much use as I could of the built-in DOM methods with additional effort made to maintain a clean UI for the player.
